# C++ functional helpers

I dont always like the STL way to do certain things and I sometimes miss the interface simplicity of Python or Javascript. 
This should be a collection of my personal functional style helpers for C++ intentionally not using STL conventions.
I use those helpers in my quick prototypes and experiments to speed up development. This is NOT a functional programming library, 
just a collection of little helpers. 

It may or may not be extended over time. 
Its not meant to be used in any projects, but you can do with it whatever you want ;).
